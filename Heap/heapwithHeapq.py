"""
Python's built-in heap module, heapq, differs from the standard implementation of a heap in two ways. Firstly, it uses zero-based indexing, and this means that it stores the root node at index zero instead of the size of the heap. As a result, the relationship between the index of the children and parent nodes is slightly different. Secondly, the built-in heapq module does not offer a direct way to create a max heap. Instead, we must modify the value(s) of each element when inserting it into the heap and when removing it from the heap.

# Trick in constructing a Max Heap
# As there are no internal functions to construct a Max Heap
# We can multiply each element by -1, then heapify with these modified elements.
# The top element will be the smallest element in the modified set,
# It can also be converted to the maximum value in the original dataset.
# Example
maxHeap = [1,2,3]
maxHeap = [-x for x in maxHeap]
heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
# The top element of maxHeap is -3
# Convert -3 to 3, which is the maximum value in the original maxHeap
